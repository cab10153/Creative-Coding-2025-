In the end, I think this simple UI looks nicer than the pendulum I worked on previously, and better than what I showed you on Tuesday. I left a lot of notes in my code about some of the road blocks I had integrating this code into webmidi/ hand pose. I also trapped myself into a starter algorithm that made it more difficult to apply the gestures to the other circles successfully. I tried many different routes to make it work. I will fix the code later on my own to have a working project I can hopefully use in the future!

Truthfully for this final UI I did not use any visual inspiration outside of my own aesthetic. Also I only used offical tutorials from the p5js website, things from class, and some ideas while looking through my past code for other projects I did this semester.
