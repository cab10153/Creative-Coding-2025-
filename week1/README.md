# Week 1 notes  
## Notable quotes and commentary 
1. >*"Educators who looked forward to accessing the worldâ€™s bounty of information for their lessons are faced with students who believe that finding an answer on Wikipedia is the satisfactory fulfi llment of an inquiry. Parents who believed their kids would intuitively multitask their way to professional success are now concerned those same kids are losing the ability to focus on any one thing" (Rushkoff, 9).*  
  
I found it interesting that this publication was written in 2010, far before we understood the rapid implementatation of AI and its implications. Now instead of Wikipedia, educators must worry about ChatGPT, etc.  Rushkoff was thinking ahead of his time and into the future, being eerily correct in more ways than one. This sets the stage for the importance of knowledge of programming being integral to the human user.  
  

  2. >*"Resistance is futile, but so is the abandonment of personal experience scaled to the individual human organism" (Rushkoff, 12).*  
  
This relates to the idea of what "Human Computer Interaction" should encompass, and the importance of keeping humanity as the core element. I agree that humans must not give up their agency by choosing not to resist. It must coincide with humans in the controls and a broader understanding of that.  
  
3. >*"In a digital age, failure could mean relinquishing our nascent collective agency to the machines themselves" (Rushkoff, 14).*  
  
Again, this quote feels like an eerie prediction of the current state of technology as AI and machine learning rapidly progress. It is scary to think what the future could hold and how much or little control the majority of humanity will have over this. The concept of "collective" agency is important to consider and I wonder what that could look like as technology moves forward.
