# template
This was a tough one with a lot of trouble shooting! As I wrote in the Read Me for the UI portion of the code, I tried so many
different ways to integrate my UI code into the Web Midi/ Hand Pose code and I went around in circles. In the end I couldn't properly integrate them. I am happy at least to get the Web Midi/ Hand Pose to work with Rekord Box finally (I mentioned in the comments issues with the channel/port configuration for the IAC driver).

I wish I got to do the "ensemble" in the end with the three laptops and the sound design I created for it. The original idea was
pretty cool and again, I hope to make this fully work in the future (and test it out for real!). I am going to include a recording in my submission on Brightspace of what the ensemble may have sounded like all together.

Another issue I had is that some of the gestures seemed to get confused and then would accidently control multiple parameters at once. Up and down would also trigger "pinch", if I didnt do my hand very straight up and down it would also trigger a bit of movement for the "back and forth" gesture as well. In the future I may consider gestures that are easier for Hand Pose to tell a part, but that will take some time and experimentation.

Resources here were code from Web Midi template as well as the Ml5 website for the Hand Pose gestures.
