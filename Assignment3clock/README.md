As we spoke about in our meeting, I would like to recreate the concept
of mycelium spreading from a starting point and branching off in different angles. The mycelium will grow according to seconds and minutes (maybe also milliseconds?) and then reset, resulting in a rapid growing network of mycelium across the screen. I am interested in also adding color, perhaps changing color according to seconds, minutes, etc. There are a few sources of inspiration that I'm using:

Here is also a link to the code that you made as an example for me during our meeting:
